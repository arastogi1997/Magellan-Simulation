# Metro-City-Simulation
Visualized Simulation for Metro stations, Autos and paths.

#Current Functionality :
Up-down Cyclic non-colliding (synchronized at 800 frames) METRO system running. 
Manhattan-styled (large square road network) city. Blocks added randomly where there isn't a node( junction) or a Metro station.
Autos spawned at the Start of the program where there isn't a station or a block. 
Destinations of all Autos set to nearest station.
Shortest path calculated and stored through A* Algorithm.
Animated: Red line showing path of Auto to station.
Blue lines showing Metro tracks.
Red autos, Blue Metros, Black Stations.
